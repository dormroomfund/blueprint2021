# Blueprint Project
A masterclass by Dorm Room Fund aimed at empowering diverse investors and founders.

## Blueprint Investor Track
The venture capital industry has a reputation of being homogenous and tough to break into. Together we can change that.

Dorm Room Fund’s Blueprint Investor Track is a 6-week masterclass aimed at supporting the next generation of diverse venture investors! We’re bringing together talented Black, Latinx, and Indigenous students with an entrepreneurial mindset who want to find a community and learn from some of the best startup investors in the business.

## Blueprint Founder Track
Born out of a desire to scale the impact of minority founders in the startup ecosystem, Dorm Room Fund’s Blueprint Project is a 9-week program in New York City supporting underrepresented founders of color.

We’re looking for talented Black, Latinx, and Indigenous students and recent grads with an entrepreneurial mindset and a big idea.
